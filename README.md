Knowledge
During learning is a neural network. It uses randomness in two ways:

* Random initial weights (model coefficients).
* Random shuffle of samples each epoch.

# Good configuration for your problem.

* Try one hidden layer with a lot of neurons (wide).
* Try a deep network with few neurons per layer (deep).
* Try combinations of the above.
* Try architectures from recent papers on problems similar to yours.
* Try topology patterns (fan out then in) and rules of thumb from books and papers (see links below).
